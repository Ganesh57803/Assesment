# eCommerce Data Science Assignment

## Overview
This project involves an eCommerce Transactions dataset consisting of three files: Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv. The objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and derive actionable insights.

## Task Summaries

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **File**: `EDA_Final.ipynb`
- **Description**: This Jupyter Notebook performs EDA on the provided dataset, analyzing customer distribution, product categories, and transaction trends. It generates business insights based on the analysis.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- **File**: `Lookalike_Model_Script.py`
- **Description**: This script builds a Lookalike Model that recommends similar customers based on their profile and transaction history. It calculates similarity scores and generates recommendations for the first 20 customers, saving the results in `Lookalike.csv`.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
- **File**: `Clustering_Model.ipynb`
- **Description**: This Jupyter Notebook performs customer segmentation using clustering techniques. It analyzes customer profiles and transaction data, determines the optimal number of clusters, and visualizes the results.

## Business Insights from EDA
1. **Customer Distribution**: The majority of customers are located in North America, followed by Europe and Asia. This indicates a strong market presence in these regions.
2. **Product Categories**: The most popular product categories are Electronics and Fashion, suggesting a focus area for marketing strategies.
3. **Transaction Trends**: Monthly transaction trends show a steady increase in sales, with peak months during holiday seasons, indicating seasonal buying behavior.
4. **Customer Retention**: A significant number of customers signed up in the last year, highlighting potential for targeted retention strategies to enhance loyalty.
5. **Average Transaction Value**: The average transaction value has been increasing, suggesting that customers are willing to spend more, which could be leveraged for upselling opportunities.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into customer behavior and product performance, enabling data-driven decision-making for eCommerce strategies.
